Prototype for my undergraduate thesis project. An experimental videogame that offers the barest elements for making visual compositions, and attempts to evaluate their compositive parameters.

Click on the animated picture to start. In the center, a canvas that can be filled with the circles to the right, by drag-and-dropping them. Below, a rough (and inaccurate, in this prototype) analysis of some compositive values: color temperature, symmetry, visual rhythm, and visual accent.
