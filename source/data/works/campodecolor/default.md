Prototype for my undergraduate thesis project.
An experimental videogame that offers the barest elements for making visual compositions, and attempts to evaluate their compositive parameters.

In the center lies the canvas, which can be “painted” on by dragging onto it the shapes that float across the right side.
Below, four compositive values are analysed: color temperature, symmetry, visual rhythm, and visual accent. In this incomplete prototype the analysis is not quite accurate, sadly.
