A simple browser game I made a long time ago and more recently rewrote using a different technology ([Elm]{link| url = https://elm-lang.org }).
Back then I used these words to describe it:

/What happens when you combine sports and words?
That’s right, the unholy portmanteau of this post’s title.
(...)
Spwords is a player-versus-computer match that puts your (English) vocabulary, spelling, and typing speed to the test./
