Interactive artwork commissioned by [Centro Cultural La Moneda]{link| url = http://www.ccplm.cl/}, project for which I was in charge of software programming, and which was featured in the 2013 [Design Biennial]{link| url = http://www.bienaldediseno.cl/ } in Santiago.
I was in charge of programming the design by [Sebastián Skoknic]{link| url = http://skoknic.weebly.com/ }.

The installation is set up so that visitors can interact with the projection by moving their bodies.

A web version was also developed, which is available at [their website]{link| url = http://www.ccplm.cl/color/#muestra } by clicking on the number ‘05’ and then on ‘Juega!’.
Requires a webcam and Flash.
