Utilizing a _constructed language_ as their material, I created three works. Graduation project for the Tokyo University of the Arts' New Media master's degree.

Taking inspiration in the idea that language and thought are intimately related, I undertook this linguistic experiment. I first created a very essential base language —a 'meta-language,'— and by concretizing it into three forms, I created the three works. One is a picture book, which uses its illustrations to communicate the meaning of the written content, and by the last portion of it makes use of the built up knowledge to tell a simple story in comic format. Another one is a set of four postcards under the theme 'puzzle poetry', that have a poem written on their front and the key to its descipherment on the back side. The third work is a video that portrays a conversation between two, who communicate by the movement and position of wooden building blocks. These three works' concern lies in the process of language comprehension.
