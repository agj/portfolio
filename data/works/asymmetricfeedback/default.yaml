  The word _feedback_ denotes the phenomenon, in visual or sound media, of the output becoming the input, and that input being output again, in a constant loop. In this installation, a similar thing occurs; however, the output does not immediately become its own input. The system consists of two computers, which are as follows: One of them has video for output (a monitor) and sound for input (a microphone). The other, the former's complement, has audio for output (a speaker) and video for input (a camera). In other words, one is a _sound visualization machine,_ while the other is a _video sonification machine,_ and both interact with each other. They are laid out in such a way that visitors necessarily interfere in the exchange.
