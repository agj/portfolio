  Interactive artwork commissioned by <a href="http://www.ccplm.cl/">Centro
  Cultural Palacio La Moneda</a>, project for which I was in charge of software
  programming, and which was featured in the 2013 <a
  href="http://www.bienaldediseno.cl/">Design Biennial</a> in Santiago. The
  Adobe AIR application interprets motion captured by a camera and displays
  reactive visuals and audio on a large projection. Design by <a
  href="http://skoknic.weebly.com/">Sebastián Skoknic</a>, support by Francisco
  Fuentes.</p> <p>A web version was also developed, which is available at <a
  href="http://www.ccplm.cl/color/#muestra">their website</a> by clicking on the
  number '05' and then on 'Juega!'. Requires a webcam.
