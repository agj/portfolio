Interactive artwork commissioned by [Centro Cultural Palacio La Moneda][1], project for which I was in charge of software programming, and which was featured in the 2013 [Design Biennial][2] in Santiago. The Adobe AIR application interprets motion captured by a camera and displays reactive visuals and audio on a large projection. Design by [Sebastián Skoknic][3], support by Francisco Fuentes.

A web version was also developed, which is available at [their website][4] by clicking on the number '05' and then on 'Juega!'. Requires a webcam.
