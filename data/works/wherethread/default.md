To make that which is not normally seen, visible. That was the assignment in school for which this video work was born, in which we tried to make a sewing machine's mechanism visibleâ€”where does the thread go and how does it ultimately form the stitching pattern. We tried shooting a transparent fabric from up close and in high-speed (for slow-motion playback,) but however we tried, we couldn't make its inner workings clear. Instead, hands out of focus partially covering the view of our subject seen only in portions at a time, with white and rounded shapes contrasting sharp and shiny metal ones, the sewing machine's mystery and allure only deepened.
