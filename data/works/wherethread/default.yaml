             To make that which is not normally seen, visible. That was the assignment in school for which this video work was born, in which we tried to make visible a sewing machine's mechanism, where does the thread go and how does it ultimately form the stitching pattern. We tried shooting a transparent fabric from up close and in high-speed (for slow-motion playback,) but however we tried, we couldn't make its inner workings clear. Instead, by the sudden motions of hands that would partially cover our view of our subject, which we see only in portions at a time, with white and rounded shapes contrasting sharp and shiny metal ones, the sewing machine's mystery and allure only deepened.
