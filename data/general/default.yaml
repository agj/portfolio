title: Ale Grilli's portfolio
presentation: |
              I'm <span class="me">Ale Grilli</span>, a freelance interactive media designer and developer from Chile. I like it best when making things with a cultural or educational impact. Here is a selection of projects I've worked on, mostly personal, the ones closer to my heart. Contact me any time via ale¶agj.cl <small>(just change that character for an @).</small>

              I appreciate your taking a peek at my works. Maybe you'd like to know more; if so, I'd be happy to hear from you via ale¶agj.cl <small>(put an @ there instead of that other thing).</small> Also, I have a [blog][1] that you can read, and I have [all my video games together in one place,][2] if you wanna look. Or check out the rest of my website from [the top.][3] Thanks again.
