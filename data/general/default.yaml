title: Ale Grilli's portfolio
presentation: >
              I'm <span class="me">Ale Grilli</span>, a freelance interactive media designer and developer from Chile.
              I like it best when making things with a cultural or educational impact.
              Here is a selection of projects I've worked on, mostly personal, the ones closer to my heart.
              Contact me any time via ale¶agj.cl
              <small>(just change that character for an @).</small>
closing:      >
              Thank you for having taken an interest in my portfolio. Maybe you want to know more;
              if so, I'd be happy to hear from you via ale¶agj.cl
              <small>(put an @ there instead of that other thing).</small>
              Also, I have a <a href="http://blog.agj.cl/">blog</a> that you can read, and I have
              <a href="/games/">all my video games together in one place,</a>
              if you wanna look. Or check out the rest of my website from <a href="/">the top.</a> Thanks again.
